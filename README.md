## Overview

This repository will hold the source code for figure generation and analysis of the
scenario ensemble developed in the Horizon 2020 [ENGAGE](http://www.engage-climate.org).
A manuscript (Riahi et al.) analyzing the implications of avoiding temperature overshoot
for stringent mitigation pathways is currently in review.

The source code will be published here upon publication of the manuscript.
